Code Hosting: Developers can host their Git repositories on GitHub, making it easy to share code with others and collaborate on projects.
Repositories can be public, allowing anyone to view and contribute, or private, limiting access to specified collaborators.

Issue Tracking: GitHub provides a robust issue tracking system where users can report bugs, suggest features, or discuss ideas related to a project.
This helps teams to organize and prioritize tasks effectively.

Pull Requests: Pull requests are a central feature of GitHub's collaboration workflow. 
They allow developers to propose changes to a project's codebase, review each other's code, provide feedback, and merge changes into the main branch once they are approved.

Wikis and Documentation: GitHub repositories often include wikis or documentation sections where developers can provide information about the project, its architecture, usage instructions, and more.

Integration with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tools: GitHub seamlessly integrates with various CI/CD tools, allowing developers to automate testing, building, and deploying their code.
