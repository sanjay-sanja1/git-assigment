A .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files and folders to ignore. It is usually placed in the
root directory of a project. When Git sees a .gitignore file, it will ignore any files or folders that are listed in the
file@
The .gitignore files are important in version control because they help to keep the repository clean and
organized. They also prevent developers from accidentally committing unnecessary files to the repository,
such as log files, build artifacts, and IDE configuration files@
Here are some examples of files and folders that you might want to ignore in a Git repository: - personal secret
keys or files, log files, 3uilt artifacts, IDE config files, and temporary files.
The underlying Git plumbing tools, such as git ls-files and git read-tree, read gitignore patterns specified by command-line options, or from files specified by command-line options.
Higher-level Git tools, such as git status and git add, use patterns from the sources specified above.
Patterns read from a .gitignore file in the same directory as the path, or in any parent directory (up to the top-level of the working tree), 
with patterns in the higher level files being overridden by those in lower level files down to the directory containing the file.
These patterns match relative to the location of the .gitignore file. A project normally includes such .gitignore files in its repository, containing patterns for files generated as part of the project build.
